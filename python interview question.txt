Q1. What are the key features of Python?

If it makes for an introductory language to programming, Python must mean something. 
These are its qualities:

    Interpreted
    Dynamically-typed
    Object-oriented
    Concise and simple
    Free
    Has a large community
Q2. How do you get a list of all the keys in a dictionary?

    Be specific in these type of Python Interview Questions and Answers.

    For this, we use the function keys().

    >>> mydict={'a':1,'b':2,'c':3,'e':5}
    >>> mydict.keys()
    dict_keys([‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘e’])
Q3. What is slicing?

    Slicing is a technique that allows us to retrieve only a part of a list, tuple, or string. For this, we use the slicing operator [].

    >>> (1,2,3,4,5)[2:4]
    (3, 4)

    >>> [7,6,8,5,9][2:]
    [8, 5, 9]

    >>> 'Hello'[:-1]
    ‘Hell’
Q4. How will you convert a list into a string?

    We will use the join() method for this.

    >>> nums=['one','two','three','four','five','six','seven']
    >>> s=' '.join(nums)
    >>> s
    ‘one two three four five six seven’
Q5. Explain logical operators in Python.

    We have three logical operators- and, or, not.

    >>> False and True
    False

    >>> 7<7 or True
    True

    >>> not 2==2
    False
Q6. What are membership operators?

    With the operators ‘in’ and ‘not in’, we can confirm if a value is a member in another.

    >>> 'me' in 'disappointment'
    True

    >>> 'us' not in 'disappointment'
    True
Q7. Finally, tell us about bitwise operators in Python.

    These operate on values bit by bit.

    AND (&) This performs & on each bit pair.

    >>> 0b110 & 0b010
    2

    OR (|) This performs | on each bit pair.

    >>> 3|2
    3

    XOR (^) This performs an exclusive-OR operation on each bit pair.

    >>> 3^2
    1

    Binary One’s Complement (~) This returns the one’s complement of a value.

    >>> ~2
    -3

    Binary Left-Shift (<<) This shifts the bits to the left by the specified amount.

    >>> 1<<2
    4

    Here, 001 was shifted to the left by two places to get 100, which is binary for 4.

    Binary Right-Shift (>>)

    >>> 4>>2
    1
