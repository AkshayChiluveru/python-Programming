Data types:

Data + Types -->Represents the type of Data that we are using in our program.That we are using
inside a variable
Note--> In python we need not to define the data expliclity Internally PVM will automatically determine
the datatype and based on that datatype memeory will be allocated at the runtime


Important Functions:
type()--> that is used to give the type of data that we are using inside our program

Types of Data Types:
Types of Datatype in Python?
1.Numeric Datatype: Int, Float , Complex
2.Sequence Datatype : List, String , tuples
3.Boolean Datatype: True and False
4.Dictionary
5.Set



Numeric Datatype:
Integer Datatype --> Represents the integral values
Positive Intgerals --> 0,1,2,3,5,......................
Negative Integrals --> -1,-2,-3.-4,-5,-6,-7,-7
Note : If we want to represent any data without decimal point then we will use integer datatype.
In python there is no any limit for declaring the integar datatype


Float Datatype --> represents that floating point values(decimal format)
--> float positive numbers--> 0.0,0.1.....;.
--> float negative numbers -->-1.0,0.2......


Complex Data Type:
#Complex Number
A number which is in the form of:
a+bj
a-> real part(real number)
b--> imaginary(imaginary number)
j^2-->-1
j --> (-1)*1/2

Boolean Data Type:
Boolean simple means either true or false.
Internally True is equal to 1
False is equal to 0

String Data Type:

Strings --> String is the sequence or a collection of characters within single quotes or double quote.
Note:1. If you are representing anything within a single quotes(' ')/Double quotes(" ")
than that is always
be considered as a string in python.
2. In python we don't have char datatype if we want to represent a single character
in python then that is also be considered as a string.
In Java we can represent char datatype with the help of single quotes('')
In Java we can represent String with the help of double quotes(" ")
