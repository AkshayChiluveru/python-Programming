List => if we want to store a group of dissimial elements as a single entity then we are going to use the concept of list.
indexing is important in case of list(Ordered collections of elements).
Duplicates are allowed in list.
Square brackets are used to represent the list.
Lists are mutable or dynamic in nature we can change, add, delete the elements of a list.

if we want to create an empty list:
list_name = []
list_name = list()

if we know the list:
list_name = [10,20,"hi",10+2j]

how can we access the elements of a list:
indexing and slicing.
