List => if we want to store a group of dissimial elements as a single entity then we are going to use the concept of list.
indexing is important in case of list(Ordered collections of elements).
Duplicates are allowed in list.
Square brackets are used to represent the list.
Lists are mutable or dynamic in nature we can change, add, delete the elements of a list.

if we want to create an empty list:
list_name = []
list_name = list()

if we know the list:
list_name = [10,20,"hi",10+2j]

how can we access the elements of a list:
indexing and slicing.


Builtin Functions in List:

len() Function:

len function ---> len function is used to return the length of a given sequence.(list,set,dictionary,
tuple,string)


Count() Function:

count function --> Count function is basically used to return the number of occurances of an element.
Syntax:
list_name.count(element)
Note --> if the element is not present in the list then count function will give you 0.

Index Function:
index function --> Index function is used to get the index value of the first occurance of an element
if element is not present then index function will give you an error.
Syntax:
list_name.index(element_value)

Insertion Functions of List:

In Python if you want to insert any element in the list then we have 3 Types of insertion function:
1.append function
2.Insert Function
3.extend function

Append Function:
append () Function --> append function will add any element at the end of the list.
Syntax:
list_name.append(value/data)
Note: Append function will add a single element at a time.


Insert Function:
insert () Function --> insert function is to add a given element on the given index
Syntax:
list_name.insert(index_value ,value/data)
Note: Insert function will take two arguments( indedx_value,data)
Note --> If the index value is not present in the given list then index function first check weather
the index value is positive or negative. If the index value is positive then index function
will add the element at last position of the list. and If the index value is negative then
given element will add at the first position.


Extend Function:
Extend function --> Extend function is used to add a given sequence into a list.
Syntax:
first_list.extend(second_sequence)

Append vs Extend Vs Insert:

Append --> Will take a single element at a time and it will add that element at the last
Extend --> Will take a sequence and add all the elements of the given sequence in the first list.
Insert --> add element at the given index
Join --> convert a list into string.
