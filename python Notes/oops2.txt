Note:

In object oriented Programming :
Properties --> variables/Attributes
Behaviour --> Functions/Methods

Types of Attributes/variables:

Types of Attributes/variables:
1.Instance Varibles --> Object Level Variables
2.Static Variables --> Class Level Variable
3.Local Variables

Instance Variable:

Instance Variable --> if the value of the variable is varied from object to objectsuch type of variables are known as
instance variable .
--> for every object a seperate copy of variable is created
--> For declaring the instance variable you need to use self
--> If you want to access any instance variable inside the class then you need to use self variable
--> If you want to access any instance variable outside the class then you need to use object reference

Example of Instance Variable:

class Student:
def __init__(self,name,classes,rollno):
self.name=name #"Pratyush" #Pavan
self.classes=classes #12 #99
self.rollno=rollno #99 #100
print("Student name is :",self.name)
print("Student rollno is :",self.rollno)
print("Student marks is :",self.classes)
def talk(self):
print("Student name is :",self.name)
print("Student rollno is :",self.rollno)
print("Student marks is :",self.classes)
x=Student("Pratyush",12,99)
print(x.name)
print("-------------")
y=Student("Pavan",99,100)
print(y.name)

output:
Student name is : Pratyush
Student rollno is : 99
Student marks is : 12
Pratyush
-------------
Student name is : Pavan
Student rollno is : 100
Student marks is : 99
Pavan


Static Variable:
static variable --> if the value of the variable is not varying with object to object then such type of variables are known
as static variable
--> a single copy is created for whole class
--> Static variable are declared inside the class outside the constructor
--> If you want to access static variable inside the class then you can use either self or classname
--> if you want to access static variable outside the class then you can use eithter object reference
or classname. but it is recoommnded to use class name
--> Static variable are the only variable that we can access without creating the object
