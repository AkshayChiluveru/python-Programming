What is file handling?

File handling --> It is just a concept by which we can manage and perform diffeerent
operations on file.
Operations on File --> Read,write,append

File Handling is used for storing the data.
If you want to store minimum or less amount of data then files are good.
if the data is in millions trillons then database is suitable.

Files --> .txt ,.csv

Note:
Database is already there why we are using file handling?
Suppose that we are having data have 50 students now tell me which storing mechanism is good>
Database --> Amount/sql queries/ consistency/normalization/atomicity 1 lakh --> trillons
Files ---> Minimum data

Types of Files:
1.Text Files --> Data is in the form of Text(.txt)
2.Binary files --> Data is in the form of videos, audio,images etc

Opening a file:
Before doing any operation on file the first step is to open the file.
Syntax for opening a File:
f=open("file_name","mode")  


Types of Modes:
Types of Modes in Python-->
1. r --> open existing file for read operation.
2. w --> open the file for write operation
3. a --> open the file for append operation.
4. r+ --> To read and write on the file
5. w+ --> To write and read the file


Closing a file:
Closing the file: After Completing the Operations its our duty to close the file.
Syntax for Closing a File:
f.close()


Write Mode(Operation):
For writing the data in text files we are having two function:
1.write(str) --> It will take data in form of Strings.
2.writelines(list of lines) --> It will take data in form of Lists.
Note --> if the file is not exist then w and a mode will create a new file with the same Name.
--> If the file is already exist then w mode will replace the old content with the new content
in existing file.

   
Read Mode(Read Operation):
for reading the data from the text file we are having following functions:
read() -->read whole data from file
read(n) --> read n character from a file
readline() --> read a single line(first_line)
readlines() --> read all data from a file into a list
Note --> If the file is not present(Exist) then you will get file not found error in read Mode.


Append Mode:
For Appending the data in text files we are having two function:
1.write(str) --> It will take data in form of Strings.
2.writelines(list of lines) --> It will take data in form of Lists.
Note --> if the file is not exist then w and a mode will create a new file with the same Name.
--> If the file is already exist then a mode will add the new content at the last.


With Keyword:
If you dont want to close your file again and again for that we are having with statement
With --> automatically close your close
for checking weather a given file is closed of not we have f.close() function.
f.closed() --> will return True if file is closed else True if file is opened
