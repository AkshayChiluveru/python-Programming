compiler=> Translate high level to machine code(0's and 1's)
programmer => set of instructions (humans should give)
computer programming => is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell computers how to perform a given task.
interpreter => line by line execution will be there.
Types of programming languages
static programming language are those languages in which we need to define or declare the types of data that we are using in our program.
Dynamic programming language are those languages in which we need not to define the datatype at the runtime compiler will automatically analyze the datatype

Python Programming: Python is a general purpose high level programming language.(General purpose=> commonnly use programming language)

Machine Learning Algorithms => Scitkit learn
Backend web Development => flask, Django, Tornado
Data Science and Data Analysis => Numpy , Scipy , pandas
Data Visualization => Matpotlib, Seaborn etc..
Game => Pygame
Desktop Application => Tkinter
Deep Learning => Keras and TensorFlow

Featues of python:
simple and easy => its syntax similar to english language
free and open source => you need not to pay a single ruppee for using python.
platform independent language => if we are writing python code in one operating system then we can run same code in any another operating system
Dynamic language => no need to specify the data type.
interpreted language => line by line execution.
It is both functional and object-oriented.

.py => pyhton file => python IDLE,pycharm,spyder => web development.
.ipynb => python notebook => jupyter notebook,google colab, ==> Machine Learning.

What is Anaconda?
Anaconda is a open source package distribution built on python and R programming.
Most of the libraries and packages are already present in Anaconda which are widely used in data Science. where In other IDE's you need to install all those packages and libraries manually.

Object =>
Any real world entity is nothing but an object --> behaviour and functionality.
