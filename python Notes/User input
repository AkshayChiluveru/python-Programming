In python, we can take user input directly by using input() function.This input function gives a return value as string/charancter hence we have to pass that innto a variable.

syntax:

variable = input()

But input function return the value as string. Hence we have to type cast then whenever required to another datatype.

ex:

variable = int(input())
variable = float(input())

ex: 
a = input("enter the name: ")
print(a)
