Components of algorithms

1.Input Step --> Each and every algorithm is having atleast one input
2.Assignment Step --> each and every algorithm is having atleast one assignment operator
3.Decision Step --> if and else(Optional)
4.Repititive step --> for and while(Optional)
5.Output Step --> Each and every algorithm is having atleast one output step.


Properties of an algorithm:

1. Finiteness --> Algorithm will terminate after a finite number of step
2. Definitesness --> Algorithm must be Unambigous(clear)
3. Genarlity --> that algorithm will work for any number of input
4. Effectiveness --> algorithm is effective if it is taking least time and space complexity then your alogrithm is effective
5. Input and output
If any algorithm is following all these properties then that algorithm is a Perfect Algorithm.
