Python List:
 
 --> Lists are the inbuilt data structure of python.
 --> We can store elements of different types in the list.
 --> Items in the list are enclosed between square brackets and separated by commas.
 --> We can even nest lists with other data structures like lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc.
Python Array:
 
 --> Arrays are not the in-built data structure readily available in python.
 --> We must import the array from the 'array' or 'numpy' module.
 --> Array stores elements of similar types. If we try to store elements of different types, it will throw an error.
 --> We can only store elements of the same types in the array.




Applications Of Array:


--> Arrays are used to implement data structures like a stack, queue, etc.
--> Arrays are used for matrices and other mathematical implementations.
--> Arrays are used in lookup tables in computers.
--> Arrays can be used for CPU scheduling.
--> Arrays are commonly used to store large amounts of data.
--> Arrays are used in the implementation of various graph and tree data structures.
--> Arrays can be used to dynamically allocate memory for storing data.
--> Arrays are used in computer graphics to store and manipulate images, pixel data, and other visual elements.


Real Time Application of Arrays:
 
 --> Contact lists on mobile phones.
 --> Matrices use arrays which are used in different fields like image processing, computer graphics, and many more.
 --> Arrays are used in online ticket booking portals.
 --> Pages of book.
 --> IoT applications use arrays as we know that the number of values in an array will remain constant, and also that the
 accessing will be faster.
 --> It is also utilised in speech processing, where each speech signal is represented by an array.
 --> The viewing screen of any desktop/laptop is also a multidimensional array of pixels
