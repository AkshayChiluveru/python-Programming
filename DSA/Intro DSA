Python List:
 
 --> Lists are the inbuilt data structure of python.
 --> We can store elements of different types in the list.
 --> Items in the list are enclosed between square brackets and separated by commas.
 --> We can even nest lists with other data structures like lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc.
Python Array:
 
 --> Arrays are not the in-built data structure readily available in python.
 --> We must import the array from the 'array' or 'numpy' module.
 --> Array stores elements of similar types. If we try to store elements of different types, it will throw an error.
 --> We can only store elements of the same types in the array.
